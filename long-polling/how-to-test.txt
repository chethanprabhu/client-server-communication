Steps to test long polling
1) navigate inside server using "cd long-polling/server"
2) Run the server using the command "node index.js".
3) Open another terminal and navigate to ui using "cd long-polling/ui"
4) Run the react app using "npm run dev"
5) Notice the Blank screen displaying in the browser at "http://localhost:5173/". Also in network the request is in pending. (Assuming we already did a GET call before and now we are waiting for next GET call)
6) Now open any client api app like postman and run the POST call "localhost:3000/update?prevData=new data"
7) Go back to the browser and notice the text changes to new text "new data"
